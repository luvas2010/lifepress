### Introduction ###

Anyone interested in contributing to Lifepress is free to check out code from the Mercurial repository, file bugs, and submit patches. However, until we're sure we can trust you with full commit access that's all you can do.

#### Issues ####

If you notice an error in Lifepress make sure that you [file an issue](http://code.google.com/p/lifepress/issues/list) regarding said error. It is imperative that we keep track of what was fixed and what we have left to fix. However, make sure you check the issues list so we don't end up with duplicate issues. This also applies to committers, make sure you file and close your issues!

#### Patches ####

Patches should be submitted as a Unified Diff attached to an associated bug. They will be reviewed by a committer and they will let you know what needs to be done to have your code merged into trunk. Also be sure to check the [Code Style Guide](CodeStyleGuide.md) to make sure you've done all of your code formatting correctly (we want our, particularly core, code to be nice an consistent)

#### Roadmap ####

Make sure that you check the RoadMap and try to close the related bugs!
